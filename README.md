# 🛡️ Sentinel AI

**Sentinel AI** is an intelligent threat detection system designed to identify phishing, scams, and malicious intent in real-time using the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and prompt engineering. This AI-powered solution enhances digital safety by analyzing text-based content such as emails, messages, or documents.

## 🔍 Problem It Solves

Every day, individuals and organizations are targeted by malicious actors through phishing emails, scam messages, and deceptive content. **Sentinel AI** acts as a real-time defense layer that analyzes text and alerts users of potential threats before they fall victim.

## 🧠 Core Features

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Threat Analysis**  
  Uses advanced NLP techniques and prompt engineering to understand context and intent.

- 📩 **Text Input Scanning**  
  Analyze messages, emails, or any text input for phishing or scam patterns.

- ⚠️ **Threat Level Detection**  
  Categorizes input as Safe, Suspicious, or Dangerous.

- 🌐 **No Backend Needed**  
  Fully functional with only frontend + Python integration.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript  
- **AI Backend:** Python (Prompt Engineering, NLP)  
- **Model Base:** Custom prompts + Language Model API (e.g., OpenAI)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User enters or pastes a text (e.g., an email).
2. The system sends this text to the AI engine (via prompt-based logic).
3. AI analyzes and returns a threat verdict: `Safe ✅`, `Suspicious ⚠️`, or `Malicious ❌`.
